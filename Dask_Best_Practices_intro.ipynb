    "[Dask Distributed](https://distributed.dask.org/en/stable/)\n",
    "to do parallel computations on \n",

    "## Best Practice: Use a Shifter Image to Run a Dask Cluster and Kernel\n",
    "\n",
    "For your own Dask+Jupyter@NERSC workflows, we recommend that you set up a\n",
    "[Shifter](https://docs.nersc.gov/development/shifter/overview/)\n",
    "image that you can use to run both a Jupyter\n",
    "[kernel](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/projects/kernels.html)\n",
    "and a Dask cluster (Dask scheduler, dashboard, and workers).\n",
    "This demonstration notebook uses such a Shifter image for both kernel and cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the same Shifter image for both the kernel and the cluster ensures that both have the same Python interpreter, packages, and package versions.\n",
    "Using Shifter to launch the Dask cluster helps it start up much much faster than otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Best Practice: Use dask-mpi to Launch the Dask Cluster\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to run a Dask cluster on Cori compute nodes, we recommend using \n",
    "[dask-mpi](http://mpi.dask.org/en/latest/).\n",
    "While it does not leverage MPI for communiction during computation, we have found that using MPI to start Dask cluster processes is faster and less hassle than other options.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Best Practice: Use start-dask-cluster to Simplify Things\n",
    "\n",
    "The fastest way to get a Dask cluster running on Cori compute nodes is through Cori's interactive QOS.\n",
    "But setting up the job with all the right flags is a bit complicated.\n",
    "To simplify the process on Cori, we have created a software module that provides a wrapper script called \"start-dask-cluster.\""
